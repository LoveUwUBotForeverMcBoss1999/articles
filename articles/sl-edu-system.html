                <p>Sri Lanka's education system stands as a beacon of success in South Asia, boasting one of the highest literacy rates in the region at 92%. This comprehensive system, which combines colonial heritage with modern educational principles, has evolved significantly since the country's independence in 1948.</p>

                <h2>Structure of Education</h2>
                <p>The Sri Lankan education system is structured into several key stages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Education (Grades 1-5):</strong> Focuses on fundamental skills in language, mathematics, and environmental studies</li>
                    <li><strong>Junior Secondary (Grades 6-9):</strong> Introduces a broader curriculum including science, technology, and social studies</li>
                    <li><strong>Senior Secondary (Grades 10-11):</strong> Leads to the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level examination</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Level (Grades 12-13):</strong> Preparation for university entrance through GCE Advanced Level examination</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Free Education Policy</h2>
                <p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Sri Lanka's education system is its free education policy, implemented since 1945. This policy includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Free education from primary to university level</li>
                    <li>Free textbooks for all students</li>
                    <li>Free school uniforms</li>
                    <li>Subsidized public transportation</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    "Sri Lanka's free education policy has been instrumental in achieving high literacy rates and ensuring equal access to education for all social classes."
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
                <p>Despite its successes, the system faces several challenges:</p>

                    <li><strong>Infrastructure Gaps:</strong> Need for modern facilities and technology integration</li>
                    <li><strong>Examination Pressure:</strong> High-stakes testing system creating stress for students</li>
                    <li><strong>Language Policy:</strong> Balancing instruction in local languages with global language needs</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Recent Reforms and Future Direction</h2>
                <p>The Ministry of Education has initiated several reforms to address these challenges:</p>
                <ul>
